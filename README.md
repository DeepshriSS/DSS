The first two competitions I took part in on Kaggle for hands-on practice of machine learning models. 
TITANIC Survival:
    Applied four different models like decision tree, random forest, KNN and logistic regression.
    Got the best results when used logistic regression. 
    The predictions obtained by using random forest and decision tree were quite similar.
    KNN gave pretty good predictions as well.
    
House-prices prediction:
    Applied linear regression model for predicting the house prices given numerous factors affecting the prices.
    Had to delete some of the columns and encode the rest.
